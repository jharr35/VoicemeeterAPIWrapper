[Back to Main Document](Advanced_Topics.md)

## Overview
Custom audio routing and processing are crucial for achieving a specific sound quality or for managing complex audio setups. This section delves into how VoicemeeterAPIWrapper can be utilized to create advanced audio routing scenarios and integrate with external digital signal processing (DSP) tools.

## Advanced Audio Routing
  - Routing Flexibility: VoicemeeterAPIWrapper allows for intricate audio routing configurations. This includes directing audio from various inputs to different outputs, creating mixes that suit various broadcasting or recording scenarios.

  - Virtual Input and Output Channels: Make use of Voicemeeter's virtual inputs and outputs to route audio between different applications, including DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations), streaming software, and other multimedia applications.

  - Multi-Layer Mixing: Dive into creating multi-layer mixes by utilizing the multiple strips and buses available in Voicemeeter. This can include creating separate mixes for live streams, monitor outputs, and recordings.

## Integration with External DSP Tools
  - VST Plugins: Voicemeeter supports VST (Virtual Studio Technology) plugins. Learn how to integrate third-party VST plugins for effects like reverb, compression, or advanced equalization, enhancing the audio output quality or achieving specific audio effects.

  - External DSP Hardware: Discover how to route audio to and from external DSP hardware for high-end processing. This can be particularly useful in professional recording or broadcasting setups where hardware-based processing is preferred.

  - Latency Management: Understand the implications of advanced routing and processing on system latency. Learn how to manage and optimize latency to ensure real-time audio processing without perceptible delays.

## Practical Applications
  - Broadcasting: Create advanced setups for broadcasting scenarios, where the host's voice, guest inputs, background music, and sound effects can be individually controlled and routed.

  - Recording Studios: Leverage VoicemeeterAPIWrapper for complex recording setups, routing different instruments or voices through separate processing chains before mixing.

  - Live Performance: Setup live performance environments where multiple audio sources are mixed live, processed through external DSP tools, and routed to various outputs for public address systems or recording devices. <br><br>
